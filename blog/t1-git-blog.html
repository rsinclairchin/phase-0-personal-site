        <h2>Git and GitHub</h2>

            Version Control Systems. VCS. Developers use them to save their work as they go. They make a change to their code, and they save it. Make another change, save. Change, save. Change, save. Every time they save, a new version, draft, snapshot, is made. It creates a whole history book of changes, a log of their progress. If at any point they don't like where they've ended up, they can go back to any one of these save points and start from there. No need to scrap the whole project. Just pick up where things started to go awry.
          </p>

            Git is one VCS. It keeps all those history books on the computer. It creates working branches off of the master branch, which can then be merged back together to make a new snapshot of progress.
          </p>
          <p>
            GitHub takes things to the next level. GitHub takes the history books and puts them online. This may not seem like much, but it opens the collaborative floodgates. It means that absolutely anybody with an internet connection can work together on the same project.
