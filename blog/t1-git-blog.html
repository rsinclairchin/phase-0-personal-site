      Version Control Systems. VCS. Developers use them to save their work as they go. They make a change to their code, and they save it. Make another change, save. Change, save. Change, save. Every time they save, a new version, draft, snapshot, is made. It creates a whole history book of changes, a log of their progress. If at any point they don't like where they've ended up, they can go back to any one of these save points and start from there. No need to scrap the whole project. Just pick up where things started to go awry.

      Git is one VCS. It keeps all those history books on the computer.

      GitHub takes things to the next level. GitHub takes the history books and puts them online. This may not seem like much, but it opens the collaborative floodgates. It means that absolutely anybody with an internet connection can work together on the same project.

      I am GitHub, and you can, too!

DBC is much more interactive than I had thought!
The restaurant/kitchen thing really resonated with me. I work in a restaurant, and I feel this sense of family, loyalty to my restaurant. I am a part of the crew, we together make this restaurant. I know this isn't exactly what Sherif was saying, but it makes sense to me in this way. I'm a little nervous because I am naturally a little more timid and reserved than most. If I do happen to disagree with an authority, I'm more likely to nod along with them and then go and do what I like on my own than to actually try to hold a discussion about it. The idea of DBC being one big experimentation where anything goes and we all contribute our ideas and make it our own, that is quite different from what I had expected. I wish I could just jump in with apron on and carving knife in hand, but knowing myself as well as I do, I expect I will take a minute (or a day or two or a week) to assess my surroundings and the people I'm in it with before feeling comfortable enough to really fully express myself.



GitHub was definitely a struggle. There came a point in 1......... when everything just clicked and it all made sense and it seemed like such a simple thing to get so silly mixed up in like I had. But definitely the first GitHub challenge was a struggle. I didn't know where I was or what I was doing, I was just typing out what I was told to, and hoping everything would work out at the end. And it more or less did. But it felt like it took forever, and OH I forgot at one point I lost everything. I went to merge it and I must have not saved my changes or something because it was all gone and I couldn't find it and that was terrible/terrifying. Started over, got it the second time around. It all worked out in the end.

GitHub was simultaneously the most frustrating and the most interesting. It means so much more than I thought it did.

I live in Napa, California.

Discussions. Really the only way I communicated with anybody this week.
