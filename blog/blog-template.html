<!-- It was interesting to see what my pair had come up with for his wireframe. It was so different from what I had, he had considered many features for his blog that I had not. Where I wanted mine to be as simple as possible, he allowed himself to add in many smart additions to his page. He also used a thing called Mockingbird to build his wireframe, and I used Balsamiq. I told him Balsamiq seemed a bit too complicated, and he suggested I just whiteboard it next time. I think I will! Because of all the frustration involved with Balsamiq, I didn't find wireframing to be altogether that helpful. I had a better idea in my head for the layout than I was able to effectively get accross in Balsamiq. I feel like I need to take a course just to be able to use the tool properly.
The HTML was great practice for both of us. We looked up new semantic HTML5 tags that we could use for our sites and shared our results. It was fun, and I feel like we both learned a lot. I found that the <nav> tag was the most useful for my website, and we experimented with <aside> on his, though we didn't quite get that one all the way figured out. We also studied the differences between <article> and <section>, although again, I'm not sure we got it all the way figured out.
Beyond just providing a layout for content, I am not entirely sure what makes a wireframe better than any other. I suppose minimal detail is good, and a layout that makes sense. But that seems to be pretty standard. Perhaps a little more experience in building them and seeing ones that other people have made will shed some light here in the future.
