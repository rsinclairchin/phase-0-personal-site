        <h1>Chef's Kitchen</h1>

            DBC is much more hands-on than I had thought! I'm a little nervous about being given this role, being expected to take control of my experience and forge my own path. I don't feel confident enough in what I'm doing to do that yet. It feels as though there is a lot of support and understanding at DBC, coming from the teachers as well as the students, so maybe after some time to find my footing I'll feel more comfortable jumping into the kitchen. The idea that we are all in this together is very exciting for me. I believe that will lead to stronger relationships, a sense of belonging and loyalty similar to that within a family. And with that sort of togetherness, we can conquer much more than we could solo.

            I am eager for Phase 1 to start so I can start working more closely with all of you! In the meantime, would anybody around the bay area be interested in a little get together? I'd love to start getting to know you.
