            The hardest part still of Phase 0 has been finding an appropriate work/bootcamp/life balance. It's getting easier to know how much time to set aside for Phase 0, but I'm still messing up my scheduling trying to fit in all kinds of other things. I think I might actually write out a time table for next week to carve out blocks of time to dedicate to Phase 0. I think my problem has been in allowing myself to be too flexible, relying on the fact that I can pick this stuff up any time and work on it. I'll kick in some structure, see how it goes.

            Thus far, Phase 0 and the internet have provided a bevy of resources to appeal to a great many different learning styles. I can always find some linear, concrete, straightforward tutorial that appeals to my learning style. I find that seeing the step-by-step process laid out in front of me is the most useful. Flowcharts are my jam. I'd put those sweet bastards in a jar and sell them at the farmer's market.

            A lot of the articles and reading assignments are a bit of a struggle to get through. I am not as engaged as I would be if I were watching a video or doing my own research. Maybe I lack focus. I suspect a highlighter could change the reading game for me. There's gotta be an app for that somewhere out there. I'll find it.

            I do spend some time on things not specific to my learning style, but mostly in the form of casual, curious wanderings. Like when I find a rabbit hole and want to explore things further. I think part of my time management goals for next week ought to include setting aside some time to do more exploring like this, in the interest of rounding out my learning style as well as adding depth to my understanding of certain topics that pique my interest.
