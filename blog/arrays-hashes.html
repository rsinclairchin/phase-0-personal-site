        <h1>Arrays and Hashes</h1>
        <h2>They're different</h2>

            Arrays and hashes are both containers for ruby objects. They both hold a number of things in order, like a list. That is just about the extent of their sameness.
          </p>
          <p>
            Arrays are the simpler of the two. An array holds objects in a list and that's it. Each object has it's index, an assigned slot inside the array with its own number. The object can be anything. It could be an integer, a string, another array, or a hash. Arrays can be iterated over, added to, and shuffled, amongst other things.
          </p>
          <p>
            Hashes are also lists. They are lists of key-value pairs. Instead of asking for a particular object by its slot number, it's accessed by its key. Each unique key (and it has to be unique or it won't work) returns a set value. Hashes can also be iterated over and added to, and share many of the same methods as arrays plus a few special ones just for hashes.
