            From my research, I have gathered that women have very strong feelings about being a woman in tech and other women in tech and women who aren't in tech and why they are or are not in tech and whether or not they should be. It was very difficult to find any male perspective on the issue, except to ocassionally say that they wouldn't touch this issue with a 10 foot pole.
          </p>

            The way I have seen this issue addressed has been almost as if women are being treated as though they have special needs. I've seen so many services to help women succeed in tech, so many groups for women to connect and feel supported and stick together in this man's world. It sounds like the women writing these articles and blog posts are complaining about being discriminated against, but I see women-oriented tech groups left and right.
          </p>

            I guess I won't really know what it's like until I get there, but I wonder if it's only a big deal because women are making it one. What would happen if everybody just relaxed and did what they wanted to do? From what I gather, nobody is stopping women from entering into any STEM feild. Nobody's stopping me. Nobody's even trying. I've only ever been encouraged, even been given an advantage from time to time.
          </p>

            I suspect that, although well-meaning, giving special treatment to women in tech and highlighting gender in general does more harm than good. I think it would be great if this issue would just fade away and be forgotten. But as I said, I have yet to experience what it is really like, and perhaps it really is as bad as all that.
