      Hello. My name is Rosslyn Sinclair-Chin. I am originally from Canada, currently calling California home. I like coding, drinking coffee, playing Jenga, barbeques, hockey, sleeping, photography, wine, cake decorating, dogs, listening to music, dancing, and Buffy the Vampire Slayer. I enjoy the outdoors, I only wish I had more time to spend hiking, camping, climbing and exploring. If I ever do find myself with a whole day with nothing do, I like discovering new beaches along the coast. It's a nice drive along hw 1, too, just watch out for motorcyclists.

    I went to french-emmersion kindergarten when I was 4, tried out a few of different school systems throughout Canada, Alaska, Scotland and California before finally graduating in a class of a little over 100 at St. Helena High School. With no clear direction, I drifted over to Santa Rosa Junior College. A few years of taking classes that piqued my interest, and I found myself traveling towards a mathemematics or engineering degree. Engineering was too practical for my taste, and I had fallen head over heels for caluclus, so I carried on in pursuit of graduating with a associates degree in Mathematics. Somewhere in the middle of it all I relocated from SRJC to Napa Community College, where I completed my course.

    Since 2013, I've been satisfying to urge to keep learning through online classes. Codeacademy, Udemy, and various online tutorials have served as great resources for me to get a taste for coding. I reached a point where I felt as though I had done every beginner level coding course on the internet, but was not yet ready to delve into more advanced material. I yearned for a stepping stone, and I could not find one. This led me to Dev Bootcamp, where I hope to develop my knowledge further, and also find a place where I belong and settle into a life of building wonderful things with my very own written code.

    I have no shortage of quirks. My pronunciation of certain words is a little different, due to growing up in so many different places and probably also because I find more of my words in books than I do in speaking with people. I love motorcycles. I have my M1, but no bike yet. That's my first thing to save up for after DBC. I want
