##What did you learn about CSS padding, borders, and margin by doing this challenge?

Although I did not implement a lot of padding, borders and margins to my website, I did learn the areas of the element that each affect. The margin defines the edge of the element, content has to stay within the border. The padding is the bit between the padding and the content, and is used to push content around inside the element. The margin goes around the outside of the element, and sets the distance between it and other elements, or the side of the page.


##What did you learn about CSS positioning?

There are four different ways to position an element in CSS. The default is static. Elements are just placed as they were written in HTML, they go with the normal flow of the page. Relative positioning moves an element relative to it's static position. Fixed positioning anchors the element to the viewport so that it stays in the same place on the screen even when you scroll up or down the page. Finally, absolute positioning positions the element relative to it's nearest positioned anscestor.


##What aspects of your design did you find easiest to implement? What was most difficult?

The colors were the easiest to implement if not also the most difficult to decide on. Colors are simple. If only everything in CSS were so easy. The display property was the most difficult for me to figure out. It seemed as though whenever I tried to set a display value, the results would be surprising and catch me completely off-guard. This is where I would spend a lot of time on trial and error.


##What did you learn about adding and formatting elements with CSS in this challenge?

I learned that a basic HTML site is almost as good untouched as it is with hours of CSS attached to it. I'm kidding (not really). I learned a lot about moving elements around a page, and how best to do it. For instance, I could add a fat margin-left to my header to center it, but that falls apart if you try to resize the browser window. It works much better to set text-align to center. CSS is full of tricks like that. There's a cheap, dirty way to beat something into the right spot, and there's almost always usually a neat and tidy way that won't break as soon as something changes around it.
